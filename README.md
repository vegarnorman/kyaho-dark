# kyaho-syntax theme

Kyaho is a light syntax theme made for web development. Simplicity and readability is key; Kyaho uses a lot of greys with bright, clear colors when needed, making it suitable for long coding sessions as well as for presenting code on bigger screens. Use whichever font you like; this theme works really well with [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack).
